Tekkit

Basicly if you want a tekkit server you will need the following plugins

WorldGuard (i am not going to bother telling you why you need this)
Tekkit Restrict (addon for World Guard that makes it tekkit-proof with safezones)
Tekkit customizer (lets you repair a lot of problems with tekkit and prevent them)
Disablecraft (compatable with tekkit so important)
LWC (you may already know this mod with it's famus "locked with a magical spell" but did you know it supports tekkit?)
Logincontrol (very important (atleast for server staff) to have. Will prevent identyty and permission theft)
Multiverse core (ok i didn't have to tell you this one did I?)
DeathChest (needed for a survival server because, lets face it, tekkit is more deadly then normal minecraft and has more
            important items to protect. This will send items to a pre-defined chest upon death)
Essentials and the essentials (you need the basic plugins for a normal bukkit server like essentials and worldedit)
Economy plugin (tekkit has a lot of items that promote ecomomy. Many people create factories and such)
PVP arena plugin (ok, you have guns and cannons now yay! Now they want something to shoot! (use World guard and 
            tekkit restrict to prevent it from falling apart)
Decoys (not a plugin but useful. Make greifer decoys and traps to help identify the greifers)
MCbans (you need to prevent those greifers and if you can set it up, it was worth the time)
World Border (this probably doesnt apply to you due to the server size you have, but players get as far from spawn as
            possible


Items to control

World ancor (its a 3 by 3 chunk loader that acts as if it is a player)
Nukes (it is HUGE)
Novas (they are annoying)
Cannons (they can disobay rules sometimes)
